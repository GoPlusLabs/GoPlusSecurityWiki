# Hash Collision

## Definition

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_science), a **hash collision** or **clash** is when two pieces of data in a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash\_table) share the same hash value. The hash value in this case is derived from a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash\_function) which takes a data input and returns a fixed length of bits.

Usually in blockchain security, hash collision could be used to call unexpected functions.
