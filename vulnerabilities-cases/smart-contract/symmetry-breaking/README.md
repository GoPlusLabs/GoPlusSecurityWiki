# Symmetry Breaking

## Definition

For a pair of symmetrical actions, some restrictions are missing on one side thus the security symmetry is broken, which can be exploited potentially.

## Examples of Symmetry

* Deposit - Withdraw
* Stake - Unstake
* Check-in - Check-out&#x20;

### Symmetry Breaking

In these paired actions, eg. Stake - Unstake, if you missed some checks while unstaking(eg., terminate staking rewards), the system becomes **asymmetrical** immediately, i.e. lots of rewards are distributed to the people who are already left and not qualified for rewards.
