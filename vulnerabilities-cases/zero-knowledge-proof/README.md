# Zero-knowledge Proof

## Definition of ZKP Security

In a ZKP implementation, three core principles of ZKP should be achieved to fulfil ZKP Security:

### Soundness

* All invalid proofs must always be rejected
* Valid proofs should not be faked, modified or replayed

#### Examples

* Constrains are comprimised
* Proving keys are generated insecurely or&#x20;

### Zero-knowledge

* Witness information shouldn't leak in any other place, eg. in a proof

### Completeness

* All valid proofs must always be accepted
* All circuits or programmes should be handled correctly
