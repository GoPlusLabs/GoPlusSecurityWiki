# Fault Attack

## Definition

In the hardware industry, a **fault attack** is an intentional manipulation of the integrated circuit or its state, with the aim to provoke an error within the integrated circuit in order to move the device into an unintended state. The goal is to access security critical information or to disable internal protection mechanisms.&#x20;



In cryptography related blockchain or software industry, we also call the attack along similar attack vectors leads to a similar result as fault attack.
